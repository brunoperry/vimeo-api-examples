Hi!

These are two examples of Vimeo galleries that use the Simple API
and oEmbed.

In the javascript example, you can change the "vimeoUserName"
variable to load in your own videos.

The PHP example is much more functional and allows you to load in
videos from an album, group, channel, or a user. Just append
"&album=1234" for an album, "&group=groupname" for a group, etc.

The PHP example was inspired by http://vimeo.com/hate5six

For more documentation on the API go to http://www.vimeo.com/api
